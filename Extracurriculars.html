				Alongside my academics, I'm part of several clubs, and do many things out of school!</h3>

				I play recreational softball for my county, and a veteran member of Toastmasters. In school, I am in a few clubs- including BETA, DECA, Calligraphy club, and this year, I am the social media manager of Menstual Movement.</h3>

				I like volunteering!! It can be really fun, especially when you have a good position. I might be going to the BETA club state convention this year- maybe nationals if I get lucky- I will see you all there, then! </p>
