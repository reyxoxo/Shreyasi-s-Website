This is a personal website created and designed by Shreyasi Kanse, for the 2025 Athena Awards. 
Wooo! It took quite some time to make this. This was my first ever time using HTML, and wow, I learned a lot! It took some time importing the images. At one point, I wanted a background image, but all the ones I kept finding were too small, and didn't let the text be readable. I enjoyed making this project a lot!
