This website is called Shreyasi's Space- like a cozy sanctuary that I designed for myself. I had been wanting to make a personal website for quite some time, but I had no idea how- as I had ery basic knowledge of HTML at the time. I used some tutorials and help from my dad (who's very experienced in software development) to make this. I made this website using HTML, a little CSS, and found all the images from Pinterest. It took quite some time to make this as I procrastinated at some points- and there were some things, like the navigation bar, that I didn't know how to do at first. I learned a lot! It took some time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. At one point, I wanted a background image, but all the ones I kept finding were too small, and didn't let the text be readable. I learned quite a bit from making this website I enjoyed making this project a lot! I have definitely expanded my knowlege on HTML and CSS, and feel a little bit more confident in my ability to make websites now. Of course, I have a lot more to learn, but I found this really fun, when I used to absolutelely LOATHE coding when I was younger. I want to make more webpages like these, as I enjoyed it a lot!
